# ? **ALL PROFILE SECTIONS RESTORED!**

## ?? **What Was Wrong:**
During the edit button fixes, we accidentally removed most of the profile sections, leaving only 3 basic sections instead of the comprehensive profile with 9+ sections.

## ? **What I've Restored:**

### **?? For Job Seekers (9 Complete Sections):**

1. **?? Education Section** - EducationSection component with institution, degree, field of study, graduation year, GPA
2. **?? Professional Information** - Headline, job title, company, experience, location, summary
3. **?? Skills & Expertise** - Primary skills (with add/remove), secondary skills, languages, certifications
4. **?? Work Preferences** - Salary expectations, work types (Remote/Hybrid/On-site), job types, locations, company size
5. **?? Salary Breakdown** - SalaryBreakdownSection with current/expected salary components and currency conversion
6. **?? Online Presence** - Resume URL, LinkedIn, GitHub profiles
7. **?? Personal Information** - Name, email, phone, date of birth, gender
8. **?? Account Settings** - Account type, profile visibility
9. **??? Privacy Settings** - Hide company, hide salary, recruiter contact, open to work toggles

### **?? For Employers (5 Complete Sections):**

1. **?? Organization Information** - Job title, department, company name, size, industry, recruitment focus, bio
2. **?? Online Presence** - LinkedIn profile
3. **?? Personal Information** - Name, email, phone, date of birth, gender
4. **?? Account Settings** - Account type, profile visibility
5. **??? Permissions** - Can post jobs, manage applications, view analytics toggles

```

## ? **Every Section Now Has:**

1. **?? Edit Button** - Click to enter edit mode
2. **?? Editable Fields** - TextInputs, choice buttons, toggles
3. **?? Save Functionality** - Independent section saving
4. **? Success Feedback** - Alerts and auto-exit edit mode
5. **?? Data Persistence** - Changes saved to backend
6. **?? Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes

## ?? **Test Result:**

The profile page should now show **ALL sections** exactly like it was before, with working edit buttons for every section. Each section can be edited independently and saves properly to the backend.

**You should now see all 9 sections for Job Seekers and 5 sections for Employers, with fully functional inline editing!** ??
